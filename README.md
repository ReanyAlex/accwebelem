## Context

As a front-end developer, you’ll often be building sites using to conform to a particular set of styles defined by a UI (User Interface) or visual designer. This means that you’ll have to code the HTML and CSS to match the design guidelines given to you.

When doing UI design and development work, it is also important to consider accessibility implications. In other words, you should design interfaces that are usable by people with disabilities.

Web accessibility definition from Wikipedia:

Web accessibility refers to the inclusive practice of removing barriers that prevent interaction with, or access to websites, by people with disabilities. When sites are correctly designed, developed and edited, all users have equal access to information and functionality.

Consider reading the W3C standard on Web Accessiblity for more context.
